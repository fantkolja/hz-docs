= JAAS Authentication
[[jaas-authentication]]
:page-enterprise: true

The `jaas` authentication setting is the most flexible
form of authentication, but requires knowledge
of JAAS login modules and related concepts. You can use
custom login modules and order them in a login module stack.

The following is a sample configuration which authenticates against an LDAP server or
database as a fallback:

== JAAS principals used in Hazelcast

Hazelcast works with the following JAAS https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/Principal.html[Principal^]
implementations added to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html[Subject^]:

* `ClusterIdentityPrincipal`: Represents the name of authenticated party (usually
one instance in the `Subject`).
* `ClusterRolePrincipal`: Represents the role assigned to the authenticated party
(usually zero or more instances in the `Subject`).
* `ClusterEndpointPrincipal`: Represents the remote address of the authenticated
party (usually one instance in the `Subject`).

These implementations share a common abstract parent class `HazelcastPrincipal`,
so it is simple to find them in the JAAS `Subject`.

[source,java]
----
Set<HazelcastPrincipal> hazelcastPrincipals =
            subject.getPrincipals(HazelcastPrincipal.class);

== Callbacks Supported in Login Modules

JAAS https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/security/auth/callback/Callback.html[Callback^]
instances are used for accessing different kinds of data from the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/security/auth/spi/LoginModule.html[LoginModule^]
implementations. Hazelcast supports the following `Callback` types:

* `javax.security.auth.callback.NameCallback`: Retrieves a name from `Credentials` object.
* `javax.security.auth.callback.PasswordCallback`: Retrieves a password from `PasswordCredentials` object.
* `com.hazelcast.security.CertificatesCallback`: Retrieves the TLS certificate chain (if any) of the connecting party.
* `com.hazelcast.security.ClusterNameCallback`: Retrieves the cluster name used for the authentication.
* `com.hazelcast.security.CredentialsCallback`: Retrieves `Credentials` used for authentication.
* `com.hazelcast.security.ConfigCallback`: Retrieves the `Config` object of current Hazelcast member.
* `com.hazelcast.security.EndpointCallback`: Retrieves the remote address of the connecting party.
* `com.hazelcast.security.SerializationServiceCallback`: Retrieves `SerializationService` of current Hazelcast member.

The callbacks are usually used in the `login()` method of a login module:

== ClusterLoginModule

Hazelcast has an abstract implementation of `LoginModule` that contains
shared logic and cleanup operations. It automatically creates the
`ClusterEndpointPrincipal` instance and it also provides the `addRole(String)`
method which simplifies adding the `ClusterRolePrincipal` instances.

`ClusterLoginModule` implements all methods from the `LoginModule`
interface and makes them final. It provides protected methods with empty
implementations, e.g., `onCommit()`, to align the logic to user needs.
The module comes also with the following abstract methods:

* `getName()`: It is used to retrieve the name of `ClusterIdentityPrincipal`.
* `onLogin()`: Logic of the login method which needs to be provided.

Extending the `ClusterLoginModule` is recommended instead of implementing
all the required stuff from scratch.

[source,java]
----
public abstract class ClusterLoginModule implements LoginModule {

  protected abstract boolean onLogin() throws LoginException;
  protected abstract String getName();

  protected void onInitialize() {
  }

  protected boolean onCommit() throws LoginException {
      return true;
  }

  protected boolean onAbort() throws LoginException {
      return true;
  }

  protected boolean onLogout() throws LoginException {
      return true;
  }
  // ...
}
----

`ClusterLoginModule` supports a basic set of login module options,
which allow skipping adding principals of a given type to the JAAS Subject.
It allows, for instance, to have just one `ClusterIdentityPrincipal` in
the `Subject` even if there are more login modules in the chain:

[cols="1,1,3"]
.ClusterLoginModule options
|===
| Option Name
| Default Value
| Description

| `skipIdentity`
| `false`
| Don't add any `ClusterIdentityPrincipal` to the Subject.

| `skipRole`
| `false`
| Don't add any `ClusterRolePrincipal` to the Subject.

| `skipEndpoint`
| `false`
| Don't add any `ClusterEndpointPrincipal` to the Subject.
|===

== Enterprise Integration

Using the above API, you can implement a `LoginModule` that performs
authentication against the security system of your choice,
such databases, directory services or some other corporate standard you might have.
For example, you may wish to have your clients send an identification
token in the `Credentials` object.
This token can then be sent to your backend security system via the
`LoginModule` that runs on the cluster side.

Additionally, the same system may authenticate the user and also then
return the roles that are attributed to the user. These roles can then
be used for data structure authorization.
