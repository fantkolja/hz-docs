= TLS Authentication
:page-enterprise: true

Hazelcast is able to protect network communication using TLS.
TLS mutual authentication is also supported, which means that not only does the
server side have to identify itself to a client (member, client, REST client, etc.),
but the client side also needs to prove its identity by using a TLS (X.509) certificate.

The `tls` authentication type verifies during Hazelcast authentication
that the incoming connection has already authenticated the client's TLS certificate.

This authentication type is able to parse a role name (or names) from the client's certificate
subject DN. The `roleAttribute` property specifies the attribute name (a part of the Subject's DN)
to be used as a role name in Hazelcast.

This `tls` authentication  uses `cn` attribute from the subject DN as the role name.
For example, if the subject DN in the certificate is `cn=admin,ou=Devs,o=Hazelcast` then the `"admin"` role name is assigned to the client.
