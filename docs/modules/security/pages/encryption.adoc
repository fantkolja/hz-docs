= Encryption
:page-enterprise: true

WARNING: The symmetric encryption feature has been deprecated. You can use the
TLS protocol to establish an encrypted communication
across your Hazelcast cluster.

Hazelcast offers features which allow to reach a required privacy on
communication level by enabling encryption. Encryption is based on
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html[Java Cryptography Architecture^] (JCA).

There are two different encryption features:

. TLS protocol
** transport level encryption
** supported by members and clients
** TCP-only, i.e., multicast join messages are not encrypted
+
More details in the xref:security:tls-ssl.adoc[TLS section]
+
. Symmetric encryption for Hazelcast member protocol
** only supported by the members; communication with clients is not encrypted
** multicast join messages are encrypted, too

The preferred and recommended feature is the TLS protocol as it's a
standard way how to protect communication on transport level:
Both TLS and symmetric encryption are for encrypting the network traffic.
TLS is already superior to symmetric encryption on more than one aspect as seen
above. Symmetric encryption is only supported in member-member communication while
TLS can encrypt client communications as well. When there is no specific reason to use
symmetric encryption, we recommend you to use the TLS protocol.

Symmetric encryption for Hazelcast member protocol can be configured
with cipher algorithms implemented by security providers and accessed
through Java Cryptography Architecture.
Check documentation of your Java version to learn about supported algorithm
names. The following are some examples:

* `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding`
* `PBEWithMD5AndDES`
* `DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding`
* `Blowfish`

Hazelcast uses `MD5` message-digest algorithm as the cryptographic
hash function. You can also use the salting process by giving a salt
and password which are then concatenated and processed with `MD5`, and
the resulting output is stored with the salt.

In symmetric encryption, each member uses the same key, so the key is
shared. Here is an example configuration for symmetric encryption.

You set the encryption algorithm, the salt, password and the iteration count to be used
for generating the secret key. You also need to set the `enabled` attribute to `true`.
Note that all members should have the same encryption configuration.

NOTE: Use a strong encryption algorithm. Refer to the latest https://www.nist.gov/cryptography[NIST guidelines^] for additional guidance.
We also recommend using a random string of at least sixteen characters (128 bits) for the salt.

Since symmetric encryption relies on JCA, you can additionally benefit from the
algorithms provided by the Bouncy Castle Crypto APIs. For this,
you need to set the `hazelcast.security.bouncy.enabled` property to `true`.
