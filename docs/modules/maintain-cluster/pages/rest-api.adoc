= {open-source-product-name} REST API
[[rest-api]]

include::clients:partial$rest-deprecation.adoc[]

Hazelcast provides a REST interface: it provides an HTTP service
in each cluster member so that you can access your data
structures and cluster using the HTTP protocol.

== Enabling REST API

REST service is **disabled** in the configuration by default.
You should enable it on your cluster members to use the REST client
as follows:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <rest-api enabled="true">
        ...
        </rest-api>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    rest-api:
      enabled: true
----
====

== Changing Default Port

Hazelcast uses `5701` as the default port for REST API communications.
To change it you can use the advanced network configuration as shown in
the below declarative example:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <advanced-network enabled="true">
        <rest-server-socket-endpoint-config>
            <port auto-increment="false">8080</port>
            ...
        </rest-server-socket-endpoint-config>
    </advanced-network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  advanced-network:
    enabled: true
    rest-server-socket-endpoint-config:
      port:
        auto-increment: false
        port: 8080
      ...
----
====

See the xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#setting-up-rest-server-socket-endpoint-configuration[REST Server Socket Endpoint Configuration section] for more details including the programmatic configuration option.

You can also use the xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#port[Port configuration element] to change the default
port for REST API.

== Enabling Endpoint Groups

Hazelcast uses grouped endpoints to provide the communication
via REST interface. In this section, as an example, we show various operations
that are performed on the **data structures** in a cluster using the REST calls.
For these operations to work, in addition to enabling the REST service as shown above,
you also need to enable the `DATA` endpoint group which allows accessing the data structures,
as shown below:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <rest-api enabled="true">
            <endpoint-group name="DATA" enabled="true"/>
        </rest-api>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        DATA:
          enabled: true
----
====

See the <<using-the-rest-endpoint-groups, Using the REST Endpoint Groups section>> for details
and to learn about the other endpoint groups Hazelcast offers.

In terms of data structures, **currently maps and queues are supported**.
Assuming `mapName` and `queueName` are already configured in your Hazelcast,
the structure of REST calls is shown below:

`+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key+`

`+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/queueName+`

For the operations to be performed, standard REST conventions for HTTP calls are used.

All parameters that are used in REST API URLs, such as
the distributed data structure and key names, must be
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[URL encoded^]
when composing a call. As an example, `name.with/special@chars`
parameter value would be encoded as `name.with%2Fspecial%40chars`.

== REST Client GET/POST/DELETE Examples

All the requests below can return one of the following responses in case of a failure.

* If the HTTP request syntax is not known, the following response is returned.
+
```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Length: 0
```
+
* In case of an unexpected exception, the following response is returned.
+
```
< HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
< Content-Length: 0
```

=== Creating/Updating Entries in a Map

You can put a new `key1/value1` entry into a map by using `POST` call to
`+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key1+` URL.
This call's content body should contain the value of the key.
Also, if the call contains the MIME type, Hazelcast stores this information, too.

An example `POST` call is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "bar"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
----

It returns the following response if successful:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
----

If your `POST` call has a trailing slash, Hazelcast will strip it so that it is not appended to the key string. So if you send this `POST` call:

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "bar"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo/
----

The `POST` call will instead be processed as below:

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "bar"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
----

=== Retrieving Entries from a Map

If you want to retrieve an entry, you can use a `GET` call
to `+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key1+`.
You can also retrieve this entry from another member of your cluster, such as
`+http://<another member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key1+`.

An example of a `GET` call is shown below.

```
curl -X GET http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
```

It returns the following response if there is a corresponding value:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 3
bar
```

This `GET` call returned a value, its length and also the MIME type
(`text/plain`) since the POST call example shown above included the MIME type.

It returns the following if there is no mapping for the given key:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
< Content-Length: 0
----

Similarly to the `POST` call, Hazelcast will strip the trailing slash from your `GET` call.

=== Removing Entries from a Map

You can use a `DELETE` call to remove an entry. An example `DELETE` call is shown below with its response.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X DELETE http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
----

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
```

If you leave the key empty as follows, the `DELETE` call deletes all entries from the map.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X DELETE http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName
----

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
----

=== Offering Items on a Queue

You can use a `POST` call to create an item on the queue. An example is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "foo"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents
----

The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance.getQueue("myEvents").offer("foo");`.

It returns the following if successful:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
----

It returns the following if the queue is full and the item is not able to be offered to the queue:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
< Content-Length: 0
----

=== Retrieving Items from a Queue

You can use a `DELETE` call for retrieving items from a queue.
Note that you should state the poll timeout while polling for queue events by an extra path parameter.

An example is shown below (**10** being the timeout value).

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X DELETE \http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents/10
----

The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance.getQueue("myEvents").poll(10, SECONDS);`.
Below is the response.

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 3
foo
----

When the timeout is reached, the response is `No Content` success, i.e.,
there is no item on the queue to be returned.

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
< Content-Length: 0
----

=== Getting the Queue Size

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X GET \http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents/size
----

The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance.getQueue("myEvents").size();`.
Below is an example response.

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 1
5
----

== Checking Cluster Status

Besides the above operations, you can check the status of your cluster,
an example of which is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/cluster
----

The response is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "members": [
    {
      "address": "<member IP address>:<port>",
      "liteMember": false,
      "localMember": true,
      "uuid": "73f5d6ad-7b51-4e74-bd74-15b2e7de7edd",
      "memberVersion": "4.0.0"
    },
    {
      "address": "<another member IP address>:<port>",
      "liteMember": false,
      "localMember": false,
      "uuid": "e8b41ac6-9db9-43f1-9e98-8b0392891560",
      "memberVersion": "4.0.0"
    },
    {
      "address": "<another member IP address>:<port>",
      "liteMember": false,
      "localMember": false,
      "uuid": "c6929312-d4d3-4527-83bc-474c229394d6",
      "memberVersion": "4.0.0"
    }
  ],
  "connectionCount": 1,
  "allConnectionCount": 3
}
----

== Checking Instance Name

Additionally, you can check the name of any instance of your cluster.
An example is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/instance
----

The response is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 27

{"name":"adoring_brattain"}
----

---

RESTful access is provided through any member of your cluster.
You can even put an HTTP load-balancer in front of your cluster members for load balancing and fault tolerance.

NOTE: You need to handle the failures on REST polls as there is no transactional guarantee.

== Managing Cluster's State
[[using-rest-api-for-cluster-management]]

Besides the Management Center's xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#persistence[Persistence tab] and
the script xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#using-the-hz-cluster-admin-script[hz-cluster-admin], you can also use the REST API to manage your cluster's state.
The following are the operations you can perform.

NOTE: Some of the REST calls listed below need their REST endpoint groups to be enabled.
See the <<using-the-rest-endpoint-groups, REST Endpoint Groups section>> on how to enable them.

Also note that the value of `$\{PASSWORD}` in the following calls is checked only if
the security is xref:security:enable-security.adoc[enabled] in Hazelcast, i.e., if you have Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}.
If the security is disabled, the `$\{PASSWORD}` can be left empty.

[cols="5a"]
.REST API calls
|===
|**{open-source-product-name} commands**

* _Checking if a member is ready to be used:_
+
When a member joins the cluster, you can check whether it is ready to be used with the following HTTP call.
It should return the `200` status code, meaning that the member can be safely used.
Otherwise, it returns the `503` status code indicating the member is not available yet.
Only HTTP GET request method is supported.
+
[source,shell]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/health/ready
----
* _Getting the cluster state:_
+
To get the state of the cluster, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&${PASSWORD}" http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/state
----
+
* _Changing the cluster state:_
+
To change the state of the cluster to `frozen`, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&${PASSWORD}&${STATE}" http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/changeState
----
+
* _Shutting down the cluster:_
+
To shutdown the cluster, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&${PASSWORD}"  http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/clusterShutdown
----
+
* _Querying the current cluster version:_
+
To get the current cluster version, use the following `curl` command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version
  {"status":"success","version":"3.9"}
----

|[[partial-start-force-start]]**{enterprise-product-name} commands**

* _Triggering a partial-start on the cluster:_
+
To trigger a partial-start when Persistence is enabled, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&${PASSWORD}" http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/partialStart/
----
+
* _Triggering a force-start on the cluster:_
+
To trigger a force-start when Persistence is enabled, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&${PASSWORD}" http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/forceStart/
----
+
NOTE: You can also perform the above operations (partialStart and forceStart) using
the *Persistence* tab of Hazelcast Management Center or using the script `hz-cluster-admin`.
See the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#persistence[Persistence]
and xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#using-the-hz-cluster-admin-script[hz-cluster-admin] sections.
+
* _Initiating a Backup:_
+
To initiate a backup of the persistence store, use the following `curl` command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&${PASSWORD}" http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/backup
----
+
* _Changing the cluster version:_
+
To upgrade the cluster version, after having upgraded all members of your cluster to
a new minor version, use the following `curl` command:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&${PASSWORD}&${CLUSTER_VERSION}" http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version
----
+
For example, assuming the default cluster name and password, issue the following command to any member
of the cluster to upgrade from cluster version 3.8 to 3.9:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --data "dev&dev-pass&3.9" http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version
  {"status":"success","version":"3.9"}
----
+
NOTE: You can also perform the above cluster version operations using Hazelcast Management Center
or using the script `hz-cluster-admin`. See the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#rolling-upgrade[Rolling Member Upgrades]
and xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#using-the-hz-cluster-admin-script[hz-cluster-admin] sections.

== Using REST Endpoint Groups
[[using-the-rest-endpoint-groups]]

Hazelcast members exposes various REST endpoints and these are grouped.
REST endpoint groups are as follows:

* `CLUSTER_READ`
* `CLUSTER_WRITE`
* `HEALTH_CHECK`
* `PERSISTENCE`
* `WAN`
* `DATA`
* `CP`


IMPORTANT: Using the REST service is disabled by default.
To be able to use the REST endpoints, you need to
enable the REST API as follows:

[tabs]

You can enable or disable any REST endpoint group using
the following declarative configuration (`HEALTH_CHECK` group is used as an example):

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <rest-api enabled="true">
            <endpoint-group name="HEALTH_CHECK" enabled="false"/>
        </rest-api>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        HEALTH_CHECK:
          enabled: false
----
====

The following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
RestApiConfig restApiConfig = new RestApiConfig()
        .setEnabled(true)
        .disableGroups(RestEndpointGroup.HEALTH_CHECK);
Config config = new Config();
config.getNetworkConfig().setRestApiConfig(restApiConfig);
----

Alternatively, you can also use the `advanced-network` element for the same purpose:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <advanced-network enabled="true">
        <rest-server-socket-endpoint-config>
            <endpoint-groups>
                <endpoint-group name="HEALTH_CHECK" enabled="false"/>
            </endpoint-groups>
        </rest-server-socket-endpoint-config>
    </advanced-network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  advanced-network:
    enabled: true
    rest-server-socket-endpoint-config:
      endpoint-groups:
        HEALTH_CHECK:
          enabled: false
----
====

And the following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
RestServerEndpointConfig restServerEndpointConfig = new RestServerEndpointConfig().disableGroups(RestEndpointGroup.HEALTH_CHECK);
Config config = new Config();
config.getAdvancedNetworkConfig()
      .setEnabled(true)
      .setRestEndpointConfig(restServerEndpointConfig);
----

NOTE: See the xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc[Advanced Network Configuration section]
for more information about the `advanced-network` element.

When you enable or disable a REST endpoint group, all the endpoints in that group
are enabled or disabled, respectively. For the examples above, we disabled the endpoints
belonging to the `HEALTH_CHECK` endpoint group.

== Security
[[rest-api-security]]

As mentioned previously in this section, REST API is disabled by default and this is for security reasons.
Once it is enabled for a given endpoint group, some endpoints belonging to that group can be called by any application.

REST API does not check xref:security:client-authorization.adoc#permissions[permissions], that you may configure for the other clients.
If you set permissions for the REST API, keep in mind that they will not be enforced.

On the other hand, you can request authentications for various REST endpoints. These are the following:

* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map`
* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/allmaps`
* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues`
* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig`
* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/pausePublisher`
* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/stopPublisher`
* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/resumePublisher`
* `/hazelcast/rest/wan/consistencyCheck/map`
* `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/version (POST)`
* `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/clusterShutdown`
* `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/changeState`
* `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/memberShutdown`
* `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/forceStart`
* `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/partialStart`
* `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/nodes`
* `/hazelcast/rest/cp-subsystem/groups`
* `/hazelcast/rest/cp-subsystem/members`
* `/hazelcast/rest/cp-subsystem/reset`
* `/hazelcast/health/cluster-state`
* `/hazelcast/rest/log-level (GET)`
* `/hazelcast/rest/log-level (POST)`
* `/hazelcast/rest/log-level/reset`
* `/hazelcast/rest/license (POST)`

Here is a configuration example to request authentication for a REST endpoint.

Note that you should enable security in the configuration, i.e., you should have the Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}.
Assuming we have the above authentication configuration, the following is a REST call for the `/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/state` endpoint, which includes the username and password as call parameters:

```
curl --data "test&a1234" https://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/state
```

NOTE: In the above configuration example, `identity` is for the members that may
join the cluster. This way you can use the `identity` credentials to authenticate new members
and `simple` authentication credentials for the REST calls; if there is no `identity` configuration,
and you want to add more members to the cluster, they will fail to join it.
