= Mapping to Hazelcast Maps
:description: To query entries in maps, you need to create a mapping with the map connector so that the SQL service knows how to access the entries.
:page-aliases: sql:imap-connector.adoc

{description}

== What is the Map Connector

The map connector allows you to create mappings to a distributed map in a local Hazelcast cluster. 

== Installing the Connector

This connector is included in Hazelcast.

== Permissions
[.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

If xref:security:enable-security.adoc[security] is enabled, you can set up permissions to restrict clients' access to maps.

For example, to restrict reads on maps, you can use the `create` and `read` permissions. To restrict inserts, you can use the `put` permission.

For details, see xref:security:client-authorization.adoc[].

== Creating a Mapping to a Map

To create a mapping to a map in SQL, you must tell Hazelcast how to serialize/deserialize the keys and values by specifying the `keyFormat` and `valueFormat` options in the `CREATE MAPPING` statement.

For maps whose keys and values are primitives, you need to set these options to the SQL type that corresponds to the primitive:

- `keyFormat`
- `valueFormat` 

For example, to create a mapping for `IMap<Integer, String>`:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat'='int',
    'valueFormat'='varchar'
)
```

For a reference, see xref:data-types.adoc[].

For object formats, you must specify other options, depending on the serialization format:

* <<portable-objects, Portable>>
* <<compact-objects, Compact>>
* <<json-objects, JSON>>
* <<java-objects, Java>>

=== Portable Objects

If your map's keys or values are portable, you need to provide the following additional options:

* `keyPortableFactoryId`/ `valuePortableFactoryId`
* `keyPortableClassId`/ `valuePortableClassId`
* `keyPortableVersion`/ `valuePortableVersion` (optional, default is `0`)

For example, to create a mapping for a map where both key and value are Portable:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'portable',
    'keyPortableFactoryId' = '123',
    'keyPortableClassId' = '456',
    'keyPortableVersion' = '0',  -- optional
    'valueFormat' = 'portable',
    'valuePortableFactoryId' = '123',
    'valuePortableClassId' = '789',
    'valuePortableVersion' = '0'  -- optional
)
```

If you omit a column list from the `CREATE MAPPING` statement, Hazelcast will
resolve the column names and types by looking at the `ClassDefinition` with the given factory ID, class ID, and version.

If the `ClassDefinition` with the given IDs is not known to the cluster,
you must provide a column list so that Hazelcast can use it to create the `ClassDefinition`.

For more information about this serialization option, see xref:serialization:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[].

=== Compact Objects

If your map's keys or values have `Compact` format, you need to provide the following additional options:

* `keyCompactTypeName` / `valueCompactTypeName`

The column list is mandatory and Hazelcast will create the `Compact` objects 
schema based on the column list.

The benefit of this format is that it doesn't deserialize the whole key
or value when reading only a subset of fields. Also it doesn't require a
custom Java class to be defined on the cluster, so it's usable for
non-Java clients similar to `Portable`. And it is more space-efficient than 
`Portable`.

Example mapping where both key and value are `Compact`:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map ( 
	id INT EXTERNAL NAME "__key.id",
	name VARCHAR,
	surname VARCHAR,
	age INT)
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'compact',
    'keyCompactTypeName' = 'personId',
    'valueFormat' = 'compact',
    'valueCompactTypeName' = 'person'
)
```

For more information about this serialization option, see xref:serialization:compact-serialization.adoc[].

=== JSON Objects

If values are in the JSON format, configure the `valueFormat` field as xref:working-with-json.adoc[`json` or `json-flat`].

.JSON
```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'bigint',
    'valueFormat' = 'json');
```

.JSON-FLAT
```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map(
    __key BIGINT,
    ticker VARCHAR,
    amount INT)
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'bigint',
    'valueFormat' = 'json-flat');
```

=== Java Objects

For maps whose keys or values are serialized with Java serialization, `DataSerializable` or `IdentifiedDataSerializable`, you need to provide the name of the Java class into which you want to serialize data, using the following additional options:

- `keyJavaClass` / `valueJavaClass`

For example:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'java',
    'keyJavaClass' = 'java.lang.Long',
    'valueFormat' = 'java',
    'valueJavaClass' = 'com.example.Person')
```

If the Java class corresponds to one of the basic data types (numbers,
dates, strings), that type will be used for the key or value
and mapped as a column named `__key` for keys and `this` for values. In
the example above, the key will be mapped with the `BIGINT` type. In
fact, the above `keyFormat` and `keyJavaClass` duo is equivalent to
`'keyFormat'='bigint'`.

If the Java class is not one of the basic types:

- Hazelcast will analyze the class using reflection and use its properties as column names.
+
Hazelcast recognizes public fields and JavaBean-style getters. If some property has a non-primitive type, it will be mapped under the `OBJECT` type.
- The class must be available to the cluster.
+
You can either add the class to the
members' classpaths by creating a JAR file and adding it to the `lib`
directory, or you can use user code deployment. User code deployment
must be enabled on the members, see xref:clusters:deploying-code-from-clients.adoc[] for details.
