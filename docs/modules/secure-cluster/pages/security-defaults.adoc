= Security Defaults
[[security-defaults]]

Generally speaking:

* Hazelcast port 5701 is used for all communication by default. Please see the
xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#port[Port section]
for different configuration methods, and its attributes. 
* REST API and Memcache interfaces are disabled by default.
* For all distributions (JAR, ZIP/TAR and cloud distributions), a security overview is shown on the Hazelcast startup
(to inform whether the cluster is open to network or just local, which modules are enabled and disabled).
* When a feature is disabled by default, an instructional message is shown regarding how to enable it.

Hazelcast provides the following security defaults for its different distributions.

If you are using `hazelcast.jar`:

* Access to all available network interfaces is enabled since this distribution's usage is
mostly for distributed caching.
* The Jet engine is disabled, see the xref:security:overview.adoc[Security Overview section] for the reasoning.
* Advanced features such as remote code deployment, SQL and pipelines are disabled.

If you are using Hazelcast download packages (ZIP/TAR):

* This is a localhost-only setup, and all the features are enabled by default (both for full and slim distributions)

If you are using Hazelcast on Docker and Kubernetes environments:

* Since these environments don’t allow any access unless specified explicitly,
all the features are enabled in the Hazelcast distributions on these cloud environments.

== Defaults by distribution type

The table shows which security hardening features are used by default in the given distribution type.
